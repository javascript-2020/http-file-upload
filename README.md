<h3>http-file-upload</h3>

http-file-upload is a http server whose only function is to upload and download files ( of any size )
the http server has been designed as a single, no dependency, file for ease of use and portability

files can be uploaded and downloaded 
- using the built browser interface 
- by a http request, such as those made through node.js, php, curl, python, c++, c#, java

<br>

### install
global installation is the recommended way to install

    npm install http-file-upload -g

http-file-upload can then be run from anywhere on the file system by typing on the command line

      http-file-upload
      
<br>
      
note : **windows powershell users**
running powershell scripts are disabled by default

to get the script to run normally in powershell users will have to delete ` http-file-upload.ps1 ` file from the default npm script installation directory

this is usually ` c:/users/<user_name>/AppData/Roaming/npm/ `

<br>
<br>

see also alternative installation methods below

<br>

### uninstall
after global installation

     npm uninstall http-file-upload -g 

<br>
<br>
<br>

the server listens on all network interfaces, the default port is 3000
<br>

the built in user interface is accessible at ( on all network interfaces )

https://127.0.0.1:3000/ or https://127.0.0.1:3000/hello

<br>

http-file-upload supports the following command line parameters

-p port
sets the port the server listens on 

-d dir
sets a directory to put new uploads or where to find files for download, its relative to the directory the script was started from, if the directory does not exist it is created

-cwd
sets the current working directory for the script

https | http
set whether the server uses https ( default ) or http
if you need the ca cert you can download it from ` /cacert `
<br>
<br>
downloading a file using a http request 
https://127.0.0.1:3000/download?<filename>

a list of all files available to download is available from, an array in JSON format is returned 
https://127.0.0.1:3000/download-list

to upload a file using a http request
https://127.0.0.1:3000/upload?&lt;filename>

<br>

### example useage

upload/download files in the current directory 

( requires global installation or the launch script on the system path )

`http-file-upload`

upload/download files in the current directory using port 4000

( requires global installation or the launch script on the system path )

`http-file-upload -p 4000`

if http-file-upload has been installed globally, and you have some files you want to access over http in a directory ` /work/tmp/ ` 
1. change to directory ` /work/tmp/ `
2. type ` http-file-upload ` press enter
3. open a web browser at https://localhost:3000/  or perform a http request 

```     
   
var url     = 'https://localhost:3000/download?myfile.js';
var opts    = {rejectUnauthorized:false};

require('https').get(url,opts,async res=>{

	var body    = '';
	for await(data of res)body   += data;
	console.log(body);
			
});
        
```

to download all files in a directory via nodejs        

```

var url     = 'https://localhost:3000/';
var opts    = {rejectUnauthorized:false};
var https   = require('https');

https.get(`${url}download-list`,opts,async res=>{
 
	var body    = '';
	for await(data of res)body   += data;
	var json    = JSON.parse(body);
	
	json.files.forEach(file=>{

         https.get(`${url}download?${file}`,opts,res=>{
           
               var fd    = fs.createWriteStream(filename);
               res.pipe(fd);
         			
         });
	      
	});
 			
});      
			  
```


to upload a file in nodejs
	
```

var url     = 'https://localhost:3000/upload?my-file.txt';
var body    = require('fs').readFileSync('my-file.txt');

var req 	= require('https').request(url,{method:'post'},rec);
req.write(body);
req.end();

req.on('error', function(err){
    console.log(err);
});

async function rec(res){
    
    var body = '';
    for await(data of res)body+=data;
    console.log(body);
    
}//rec

```

to upload a file from the browser

```

var input         = document.createElement('input');
input.type        = 'file';
input.onchange    = onchange;
input.click();

async function onchange(e){

      var file    = input.files[0];
      var url     = `https://localhost:3000/upload?${file.name}`;
      var res     = await fetch(url,{method:'post',body:file});
      var txt     = await res.text();
      console.log(txt);
      
}//onchange    

```
    
download with curl

```
curl --insecure https://localhost:3000/download?my-file.txt
```    

<br>

serving files from an alternate directory 

if you installed http-file-upload locally at `/work/http-file-upload/`
and wish to access files at ` /work/tmp/ `

```
npx http-file-upload.js -cwd /work/tmp/
```

if you downloaded the single file http-file-upload.js to `/work/http-file-upload/`
and wish to access files at ` /work/tmp/ `

```
node http-file-upload.js -cwd /work/tmp/
```

<br>

### alternative installation methods

### install locally :

    npm install http-file-upload

this will download http-file-upload to ` ./node_modules/http-file-upload `

http-file-upload can then be run using the command

    npx http-file-upload

### install from github

download the repository as a zip file

    https://github.com/javascript-2020/http-file-upload/zipball/main/
    
download the single file `http-file-upload.js` from github

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/javascript-2020/main/http-file-upload.js

clone the repository 

    git clone https://github.com/javascript-2020/http-file-upload.git
https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

<br>

if you would then like http-file-upload to be accessible from anywhere on the file system, the http-file-upload directory should be added to the system path,
http-file-upload comes with the following shell scripts to launch the process :

   windows ..... `http-file-upload.bat ` 
   
  mac ............... ` http-file-upload.sh `
  
  linux .............. ` http-file-upload.sh `
